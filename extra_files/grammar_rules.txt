PRESENT SIMPLE TENSE
-----------------------------------------
Form
Positive statement: I play, He plays
Negative statement: I do not play (I don't play), He does not play (He doesn't play)
Question form: Do you play? Does he play?
Negative question: Do you not play? (Don't you play?) Does he not play? (Doesn't he play?)
The passive voice: The game is played. The letters are written.

Spelling
- We only use -s ending (plays) in the third person singular.
- We add -es to the verbs that end in ss, sh, ch, x and o: misses, finishes, watches, mixes, goes.
- If the verb ends in a consonant and -y, we change -y into -i and use the -es ending: carry - carries, try - tries.
  But: play - plays, because this verb ends with a vowel and -y.
- The auxiliary verb do is not used to make questions and negative statements with modal verbs and the verb to be.
  Are you a student? Is he in London? I am not at home. He is not happy. Can you sing? Must I come? I cannot swim. He mustn't stay.
- If the wh- pronoun introducing the question (who, which) is the subject of the question, we do not use the auxiliary verb do.
  Compare the following sentences:
  Who knows you? (who is the subject)
  Which cars belong to you? (which cars is the subject)
  But: Who do you know? (who is the object)
- The negative question normally expresses a surprise.
  Doesn't he work?

Use
1. We use the present simple tense for activities that happen again and again (everyday, sometimes, ever, never).
  I sometimes go to school by bike. You don't speak Greek. Do they get up early?
  He often travels. She doesn't work. Does she ever help you?
2. We use it for facts that are always true.
  Our planet moves round the sun.
  Lions eat meat.
3. With a future time expression (tomorrow, next week) the present simple is used for planned future actions (timetables).
  The train leaves at 8.15.
  They return tonight.

PRESENT CONTINUOUS TENSE
-----------------------------------------
Form
Positive statement: I am playing, You are playing, He is playing
Negative statement: I am not playing (I'm not playing), You are not playing (You aren't playing), He is not playing (He isn't playing)
Question: Are you playing? Is he playing?
Negative question: Are you not playing? (Aren't you playing?) Is he not playing? (Isn't he playing?)
The present continuous tense is formed with the verb to be and the present participle (-ing ending).
The negative question normally expresses a surprise: Isn't he working?

Use
1. If we want to say that something is happening at the time of speaking. We often use it with time expressions such as now or at the moment.
  I am doing housework at the moment.
  You aren't listening to me now!
  Look at him! What is he doing?
2. For temporary activities that are true now, but maybe not happening at the time of speaking. Time expressions such as today, this week or these days are typical of this use.
  I am in London. I am learning English here.
  She can't go out today. She is preparing for an exam.
  You can't meet him this week. He is working in Bath.
3. For planned future arrangements. The time of the action must be given in the sentence (soon, tomorrow, on Monday, next week), otherwise it is not clear that we talk about future.
  I am coming soon.
  We are leaving on Monday.
  She is starting next week.
4. With always to express the idea that something happens too often and it annoys the speaker.
  I am always forgetting my keys.
  He is always smoking in the living room!

We do not normally use in the continuous the following groups of verbs (so called state verbs):
1. Of senses: feel, hear, see, smell, taste. On the other hand, look, watch or listen are action verbs and can be used in the continuous:
  I can hear you. - I am listening to you.
  Can you see the bird? - Are you looking at the bird?
2. Of liking and disliking: like, love, hate, fear, detest, want, wish...
  I like animals.
  I hate snakes.
3. Of mental states: agree, believe, forget, know, remember, suppose, think...
  I agree with you.
  I suppose you are right.
4. Of permanent states: be, have, belong, contain, owe, own, possess...
  This pen belongs to me.
  I have a new pet.
5. Of appearance: seem, appear, look, sound...
  It seems that it will rain.
  Your new haircut looks really good.

If some of these verbs are used in the present continuous, they have a different meaning. In such a case they become action verbs.
  I think he is my best friend. (mental state) - I'm thinking of giving him a present. (mental activity)
  He has a new bathroom. (possess) - He is having a bath. (take a bath)
  I see what you mean. (know) - I am seeing a doctor. I am ill. (visit)
  The flower smells beautiful. (scent) - The dog is smelling the sausage. (sniff)
  This wine tastes sour. (It has a sour taste.) - She is tasting the soup if it is warm enough.

PAST SIMPLE TENSE
-----------------------------------------
Form - regular verbs
Positive statement: I watched, He watched
Negative statement: I did not watch (I didn't watch), He did not watch (He didn't watch)
Question: Did you watch?
Negative question: Did you not watch? (Didn't you watch?)
It is formed by -ed ending. It is the same for all persons, singular and plural.

Spelling
- We add -d (not -ed) to the verbs that end with -e: like - liked
- If the verb ends with a consonant and -y, we change -y into -i: carry - carried, try - tried.
  But: play - played, because this verb ends with a vowel and -y.
- If the verb has only one syllable and ends with a vowel and a consonant, we double the consonant to keep the same pronunciation: stop - stopped. The same rule applies to the verbs that end with -l: travel - travelled.

Form - irregular verbs
- All the irregular verbs have different forms: go - went, buy - bought, cut - cut etc.
- The question and negative are made in the same way: I went - Did you go? No, I did not go.

Notes
- We do not use the auxiliary verb did with the verb to be and modal verbs.
  Were you a student? Was he in London? I was not at home. He was not happy.
  Could you sing? Could he come? I could not swim. He could not stay.
- The auxiliary verb did is not used in questions beginning with wh- pronouns (who, which) in case that the pronoun is the subject of the question.
  Who met you? (who is the subject)
  Which train arrived on time? (which train is the subject)
  But: Who did you meet? Which train did you miss? (who and which train are the objects)
- The negative question normally shows a surprise.
  Didn't you know it?

Use
1. We use the past simple for activities or situations that were completed in the past at a definite time.
  a) The time can be given in the sentence:

    When he was a child, he didn't live in a house.
  b) The time is asked about:

    He is 20 years old. He was born in Canada.
    I've been to Iceland. (present perfect) - Did you enjoy it? (past simple)

2. We use it for repeated actions in the past.

2. We use it for continuous, uninterrupted activities. If the action is interrupted (something is done in more intervals or we did more things one after another), we must use the past simple.

3. The past continuous tense is typically used:

      (These two activities happened at the same time. I was looking at the trees for some time and she saw me in the middle of it.)
      Compare with the past simple:

      (These two activities happened one after another. First she saw me and then I looked at the trees.)

   b) With a point in time to express an action that started before that time and continued after it.
      At 8 o'clock Jane was having a bath.
      (At 8 o'clock she was in the middle of the activity. She did not finish it.)
      Compare with the simple tense:
      At 8 o'clock Jane had a bath.
      (She started the activity at 8 o'clock and finished it.)

   c) To describe a situation, while the past simple is used to tell a story.
      The sun was shining. Jack and Jill were lying on the beach. Jack was reading a book and Jill was sleeping. All of a sudden, Jack raised his head. Jill woke up. Something happened.

4. For incomplete activities in contrast with the past simple, which is used for completed activities.
   I was reading a book yesterday. And today I am going to continue.
   I read the book yesterday. I can lend it to you now.

5. The past continuous can be used instead of the simple to show a more casual action:
   I was talking to my neighbor yesterday. We had a nice chat.
   (I did not do it on purpose. We just met in the street.)
   I talked to my neighbor yesterday. And he promised to help me.
   (I did it on purpose. I needed to ask him for help.)
